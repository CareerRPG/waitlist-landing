CareerRPG: MVP Product & Game Design Document
Version: 1.0

Date: August 6, 2025

Status: Final

1.0 Introduction & Vision
1.1 Product Overview
CareerRPG is a gamified career development platform that transforms professional growth into a tangible and engaging Role-Playing Game (RPG) experience. It uses the Brain Color framework to provide personalized professional growth, combining skills assessment, productivity tools, and progress tracking. The MVP is a web-first application designed to validate core hypotheses while delivering a compelling initial user experience.



1.2 MVP Vision Statement
The CareerRPG MVP will deliver an engaging, gamified career development platform that transforms professional growth into an RPG experience through brain color psychology, character progression, and productivity gamification, enabling users to make work feel like play while developing real-world skills.

1.3 Problem Statement
The modern workforce faces a crisis of disengagement, burnout, and misalignment. Professional growth is often intangible, leaving professionals uncertain about their progress and leading to a lack of motivation. Existing productivity tools track progress but fail to motivate or align with a user's purpose.





1.4 Target Audience

Primary: Young professionals and students (Gen Z and Millennials) navigating their careers.




Secondary: Organizations and educational institutions seeking innovative tools for talent development and team optimization.


2.0 Product Goals & Success Criteria
2.1 Core Hypotheses to Validate
The MVP is designed to test the following fundamental assumptions:


Brain Color Hypothesis: Young professionals value personalized development based on their unique thinking style and will engage more deeply with a platform that recognizes it.



Character Progression Hypothesis: Users are more motivated by long-term professional development when it is represented through tangible RPG character growth.


Pomodoro Battle Hypothesis: Gamifying productivity through an RPG auto-battle system during focus sessions will increase work engagement and session completion rates.


Quest System Hypothesis: Transforming real-world work tasks into game quests with clear rewards increases completion rates and user engagement.

2.2 MVP Success Metrics (KPIs)
The MVP will be considered successful if it achieves the following within the first six months post-launch:



Retention: Day 7 retention rate of 60%; Day 30 retention rate of 40%.



Engagement: Assessment completion rate >80%; Pomodoro session completion rate >70%.



User Satisfaction: System Usability Scale (SUS) score >70/100; Net Promoter Score (NPS) > +40.


3.0 Core Game Design & Mechanics
3.1 Core Gameplay Loop
The primary loop is designed to connect daily productivity with long-term growth:



Set Intention: The user accepts Quests (real-world tasks) from their Quest Board.



Engage: The user starts a Pomodoro Battle—a timed focus session (e.g., 25 minutes) where their character automatically "battles" an opponent representing the task.



Earn Rewards: Upon successful session completion, the user earns Experience Points (XP) and resources.



Progress: Accumulated XP contributes to leveling up the user's Character and Adventure Rank, unlocking new abilities and features.



Reflect: Users can review their accomplishments in their Chronicle, a journal that logs progress and insights.

3.2 The Neuroclass System (Cognitive Identity)
This system is the foundation of personalization in CareerRPG.


Concept: A cognitive identity system defining how a user thinks, learns, and grows. It is determined via a 35-question assessment.



MVP Brain Colors: The MVP will launch with four core "Brain Colors" based on the Directive Communication™ framework.


Green Brain (The Visioneer): Random/Chaotic processing. Ideal for innovation, big-picture thinking, and strategy.



Red Brain (The Executor): Linear processing. Logical, sequential, and ideal for process design and implementation.


Blue Brain (The Empath): Intuitive processing. People-centered, emotionally intelligent, and ideal for team building.


Purple Brain (The Architect): Relational processing. Detail-oriented, analytical, and ideal for research and data analysis.


3.3 Character System (Professional Persona)
This system makes professional growth visible and tangible.


Creation: After the Brain Color assessment, users select a character class aligned with their cognitive profile.



MVP Core Classes: The MVP includes 4 of the 7 planned classes.


Visionary Explorer (Green-Blue): Focus on innovation and leadership.



Technical Architect (Red-Purple): Focus on systems and development.



Creative Catalyst (Blue-Green): Focus on design and user experience.



Data Wizard (Purple-Red): Focus on analysis and research.


Progression:


Levels: A simple leveling system from 1-20 for the MVP.


Attributes: Each class has 4-6 primary attributes (e.g., Vision, Networking, Innovation for the Visionary Explorer) that improve with level-ups.


Abilities: Simple passive abilities are active from the start, with one active ability unlocked at level 10.
